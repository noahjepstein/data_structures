Some high-level details about this factory-simulation program:

This program simulates the function of a package-processing facility. It has 
provisions for multiple assembly lines with multiple workers per assembly
line, but this version only accomodates single workers and single assembly 
lines. 

The facility takes in a bunch of package data from a file, parses through it,
and stores it in a prebuffering queue. As the packages reach designated 
arrival times, they are moved from this first queue to an assembly line class. 

The assembly line does work on packages at specified time intervals as 
determined by the factory's timer. An assembly line does work on one package
at a time, on a first come, first serve basis. When the packages are completed,
they ship from the assembly line back to the factory. 

The factory takes the "assembled" packages and stores them in a third queue, 
a postbuffer. When all packages have been assembled and shipped off the 
assembly lines, they're printed from the postbuffer.

Incidentally, the program design doesn't require additional destructors. When
the program pops from a queue, it deletes the node. You pop all nodes in the 
prebuffer when you send them to assembly, all the nodes in the assembly queue 
when you ship to the postbuffer, and all the nodes in the postbuffer when 
you print. All queues are implicitly destroyed as part of the function of the 
program. Only the empty pointers to first nodes require deletion.
