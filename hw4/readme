hw4 - factory simulator w/ multiple lines and dispatch

Some high-level details about this factory-simulation program:

This program simulates the function of a package-processing facility. It has 
provisions for multiple assembly lines, each of which has a "rate" - this rate
reprsents the number of units of work the line can process in one minute. 

The facility takes in a bunch of package data from a file, parses through it,
and stores it in a prebuffering queue. 

As the packages reach designated arrival times, they are moved from this first
queue to one of the assembly lines. A "dispatcher" determines which assembly
line will be fastest, and sends the package to the "fastest" assembly line.
There are three different methods of choosing the fastest line: 
    1. lowest number of packages (uses "factoryP.cpp")
    2. lowest total number of units (uses "factoryU.cpp")
    3. lowest estimated time (total_units/line_rate) (uses "factoryT.cpp")
Once a package is loaded, it remains on teh line until work is done and the package is completed. 


The assembly line does work on packages at specified time intervals as 
determined by the factory's timer. An assembly line does work on one package
at a time, on a first come, first serve basis. When the packages are completed,
they ship from the assembly line back to the factory. 

The factory takes the "assembled" packages and stores them in a third queue, 
a postbuffer. When all packages have been assembled and shipped off the 
assembly lines, they're printed from the postbuffer.

Incidentally, the program design doesn't require additional destructors. When
the program pops from a queue, it deletes the node. You pop all nodes in the 
prebuffer when you send them to assembly, all the nodes in the assembly queue 
when you ship to the postbuffer, and all the nodes in the postbuffer when 
you print. All queues are implicitly destroyed as part of the function of the 
program. Only the empty pointers to first nodes require deletion.
