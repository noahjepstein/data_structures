"main.cpp" tests TOT.cpp, Transcript.cpp, Semester.cpp, and Course.cpp.
There are four respective "mains". Comment in and out each one
individually to test that respective part of the program. Main
for Course testing only tests the course class, while main
for the Semester class tests both Semesters and Courses. The 
Transcript main tests Transcripts, Semesters, and Courses,
and TOT main tests TOT, Transcripts, Semesters, and Courses. 
Each data structure uses its subjugate data structures, but not vice
versa. Courses exist separately from TOTs, but TOTs use Courses. 

Each main accesses and uses public member functions in the appropriate classes.

I'm getting some weird infinite looping bug, but I can't find it. 

Thanks.
